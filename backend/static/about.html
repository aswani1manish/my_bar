                            <p>For me, cocktails are about more than what’s in the glass — they’re about the moments we share around them. 
                            A well-made drink has the power to break the ice, bring people together, and turn gatherings into memorable experiences. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            I’m deeply passionate about the craft of cocktail making and have spent years refining recipes inspired by classic speakeasy bars and premium mixology programs. 
                            My style blends precise technique, thoughtful balance, and layered flavor profiles, resulting in drinks that feel bold and expressive.

                            With Neighborhood Sips, my idea is simple: speakeasy-quality cocktails are no longer hidden behind secret doors — they’re right here.

                    <h5 class="card-title">Getting into Milk Washing</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Of all the techniques I have explored in mixology, milk washing stands apart as the most sophisticated and rewarding. 
                        The process is deceptively simple on the surface — you add an acid to a spirit-based mixture and then introduce milk, 
                        watching it curdle and bind with tannins and impurities before straining everything through cheesecloth. But what emerges 
                        from that labor is nothing short of alchemy. The cocktail that inspired my deep dive into this method was the Snowflake — 
                        a drink I crafted to capture the quiet elegance of a winter evening. After milk washing, the spirit loses its harsh edges 
                        and takes on a velvety, clarified texture that carries the aromatics with extraordinary grace. The smell alone stops people 
                        mid-conversation. The taste is complex and layered, with subtle sweetness and depth that reveals itself slowly, sip by sip. 
                        It is the kind of cocktail that reminds you why the craft is worth all the effort — a beautiful result born from patience, 
                        precision, and a genuine love of the process.

                    <h5 class="card-title">Testing Creativity During Halloween</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Halloween has always been the one time of year when a cocktail menu can be as theatrical as it is delicious, 
                        and I leaned into that fully this past October. The challenge I set for myself was to create drinks that would 
                        appeal to a broad crowd while still delivering on the spooky, immersive atmosphere that the holiday demands. 
                        I started with crowd-pleasing flavor profiles — think smoky, tart, and slightly sweet — and then asked myself 
                        how the presentation could amplify the experience. The answer came through creative serving: drinks dispensed 
                        through medical syringes for a chilling effect, rims coated with black lava salt that glistened under candlelight, 
                        and ice spheres with small eyeball-shaped confections frozen inside that slowly emerged as the glass warmed. 
                        Guests were equal parts delighted and unsettled, which is exactly the right reaction for Halloween. 
                        It confirmed something I already believed — that presentation is not just decoration, it is storytelling, 
                        and that story can transform a good cocktail into an unforgettable one.

                    <h5 class="card-title">How Neighborhood Sips Was Born</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The idea for Neighborhood Sips did not come to me in a bar or a kitchen — it came on a cricket field. 
                        It was a warm summer afternoon, and while the kids ran around the pitch chasing each other and the ball, 
                        a small group of us parents gathered on the sideline, cold drinks in hand, talking about everything and nothing. 
                        Somewhere in that easy, unhurried conversation, the question came up: what if we could bring the quality and 
                        creativity of a great speakeasy cocktail right into our own gatherings? No reservations, no dress code — just 
                        good people, good company, and exceptional drinks. We started sketching the concept right there, on phones and 
                        napkins, tossing around names and ideas while keeping one eye on the game. That afternoon captured everything I 
                        wanted this brand to represent — warmth, accessibility, joy, and community. Cocktails shouldn’t feel exclusive. 
                        They should feel like they belong exactly where we were standing: in the neighborhood, among friends. And just like that, the name revealed itself. 
                        <b>Neighborhood Sips.</b>
                        Because great cocktails don’t belong to the elite — they belong to everyone.

                    <h5 class="card-title">How I Got Interested in Mixology</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        My journey into mixology started not in a trendy bar or a culinary school, but on a Disney cruise ship somewhere 
                        in the Caribbean. My lovely wife (Jia) and I had signed up for an onboard mixology class almost on a whim — it sounded fun, 
                        and we were in a vacation state of mind. What I did not expect was how quickly the experience would captivate me. 
                        The instructor walked us through the science and art behind classic cocktails, talking about balance, acidity, 
                        and technique with a passion that was genuinely infectious. Then came the moment that changed everything: 
                        I was shown how to make a B-52 layered shot, carefully pouring each spirit over the back of a spoon so that 
                        the different densities created distinct, beautiful layers in the glass. Watching those layers settle — coffee 
                        liqueur, Irish cream, and Grand Marnier stacked in perfect order — felt like watching magic happen in slow motion. 
                        I was hooked instantly. That one shot opened a door I never knew was there, and I have been walking further 
                        through it ever since.
